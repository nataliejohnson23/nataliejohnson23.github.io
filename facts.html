<h3>Facts About Me</h3>
<UI>
<li>I have lived in Northern Maine almost all of my life</li>
<li>I have had two dogs, one was named Chance and the other was named Gigi. I was very young when we got Chance so
I don't remember him much. Gigi died this past year and I have a tattoo on my right wrist that honors the day she passed.</li>
<li>My junior year of high school my dad took a job in Danville, California and I spent the year there. Halfway through the year
we realized it wasn't a good fit, and I spent my senior year back at Marshwood with all of my friends</li>
<li>I will never be able to explain the gratitude that I have for my parents for allowing me to come back here to be with my friends</li>
<li>I have had my noise pierced twice, the first time was with a tack</li>
<li>Umaine was my top school and I am so glad that I decided to go here</li>
