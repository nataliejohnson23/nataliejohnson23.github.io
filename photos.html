This page is dedicated to showing pictures of my family and friends.

<h3>Family</h3>

<p>
I am the youngest out of my two siblings. I have a brother named Derek, who is six years older than me, and
a sister named Brooke who is four years older than me. The photo above was taken just after Brooke won a bronze medal
at the Special Olympics this past summer at Alfond Stadium. Growing up, I was constantly fighting with my siblings but
now we are the best of friends. My mom and dad, who are also in the picture, are still love-birds after 25 years and
they give me more support than I could ever ask for.

This photo was taken at my Marshwood High School graduation back in 2017. My brother was finishing up his final semester
at Husson University but still made the time to drive three hours to support me.

This is the final photo that I am going to share of my family before I move to my friends. This picture includes
my cousin Gabe, Tante, and Oma. My grandmother, or Oma, moved from Germany to the United States when she was 18 years
old. She first had my mother, then my Tante, and lastly my Uncle Tom. She tries to keep some of her German styles present
in our lives, so we make sure to call Oma.

<h3>Friends</h3>

<p>
There are many friends both who go to Umaine and who do not that I thought about adding to this link. If I had the
chance to add all of them I know that I would. Since this was not a practical descision in this case, I chose to just
show my best friend. Her name is Abby and this year we will be going on 15 years of friendship. She is only a week
older than me, and we share a lot of the same interests and have a lot of fun together. Although Abby doesn't go to
UMaine we still have an easy time staying close.
